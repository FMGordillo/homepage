> TLDR: Learn by myself is boring and I got myself distracted a lot. Being on stream is like having an invisible teacher looking forward your success

## Streaming? Really?

Well, I've created my Twitch account in 2016 (like most of my accounts), and my first videos and _projects_ were focused in my high school experience

First it started with YouTube. I was behind the camera most of the time, giving people room to improve, recording vlogs, checking up on people, and doing _shorts_ of something silly going on. It was very rewarding for what I wanted to do

Then it went to Twitch, by doing unedited stuff (mostly gaming because, well, trending, hoping to be a [BIG SHOT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdCWPC3HMXU)) especially on Dota 2 (you can see one of my favorite clips [here](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/331772442), and if you know how to play, you will see several errors on my playthrough, so sorry for the cringe in advance)

## And what about now?

Now I'm focusing more on studying other programming languages, doing projects from start to finish (hopefully), and improving my [touch typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_typing) with [TypingClub](https://www.typingclub.com/)

There are several things stopping me from being more frequent:

1. I am streaming at the Steam Deck (i don't have a powerful laptop or desktop)
2. I don't have a camera to plug in (yet) and yes, I want people to see the face and the struggle
3. There are so much more interesting people to watch when I have the time to stream

But still I want to give a shoutout to the main three channels that give me the motivation to keep trying and moving forward, in no order in particular

- [Matias Baldanza](https://www.twitch.tv/matiasbaldanza), a passionate student building a frontend career
- [ThePrimeagen](https://www.twitch.tv/theprimeagen), best known as a Rust advocate, founder of The Startup (tm) and JS hater (within reason)
- [Ranton](https://www.twitch.tv/realranton), game reviewer, ex shaolin practicer (as far as I'm concern) and a master at editing videos

I will do my best to keep up with my content, and if you want to give me a follow, you can see the links below:
