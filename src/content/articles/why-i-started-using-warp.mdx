# What is Warp?

See for yourself at [warp.dev](https://www.warp.dev/), but if you **really**
want my input, I can say it's a terminal with a lot of cool features that you
might not need in your daily work, but it's pretty fun to use

# Why now? It's been around since 2021

I don't have a Macbook, that's why. They've [just release a Linux version](https://www.warp.dev/blog/warp-for-linux) and I was pretty excited to try it out.

# Have you been using another terminal?

I've been using [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) for quite some time
(let's say a year or so), and it's been awesome, because I could use my own
dotfiles to configure it to my liking, and to be portable. Aside of that,
there's not other thing to say.

# Ok, tell me more about Warp

First off, it's free, but you have to create an account (I'm not sure why
though, maybe to integrate easier with another tools?)

The installation was a breeze using their own `.deb` file, so that's a plus
right there.

Opening up, the first thing that I've loved while I was writing this article was **Warp AI**. Of course,
everything has to be AI nowadays, but what surprised me most is how much
power it brings:

![Prompt in Warp AI saying 'Convert a sentence to lowercase and replace spaces
with "-"'](/images/warp_first_time/prompt.png)

![Result being shown at the terminal, with the command, executed and showing the desired result](/images/warp_first_time/result.png)

Pretty cool right?

The performance as well it feels pretty amazing. I see some bugs related to the
terminal input (sticking at the bottom of the screen) and some history being
shown weird in my screen, but that's about it.

# Conclusion

There's a lot of work going forward with this terminal, and I will give it more
love and time from my end, hope you find this useful!
