> TLDR: I don't care much about the definition of 'blog' or 'article', but I'm figuring out if creating articles justifying decisions was a good fit for me.

## Why an Articles and not Blog page

[As defined by Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog), a blog is like a diary-style ordered in inverse chronological order (hold on, [let me cook](https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/nfl/what-does-let-him-cook-mean-the-meme-explained/ar-AA15U3Wt))

Even though this page matches the format, I don't feel that this is my diary, rather this is my justifications to all my decision.

## Fair enough, but why an "Articles" page

Most of the times I encounter myself going a few steps back thinking _how stupid, why am I doing this_? And I don't remember why. These are my justifications at the time that I created it.

Sure, in a near future I will go back and see my horrible gramar and awful spell and think "_what did I even wanted to say with this?_", but [as WheezyWaiter said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arw6MvemAkk), I should stop caring for other's opinions and start doing by... doing
