import mainComponents from '../../utils.ts';
export const components = mainComponents;

> TLDR: While I wait to be in a Masters degree, I will study in a platform that is in a similar level. Oh, and also ThePrimagen is there too, lol

## What are you studying

Thanks for asking! I am [learning Rust](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/rust-ts-devs/), [how to Vim](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/vim-fundamentals/) correctly, and [Website Accessibility](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/accessibility-v2/). Yes, both of the from ThePrimagen, you should already know that I really love its content

## What are your thoughts?

So far I'm enjoying it a lot, it's less hours that I've expected, but there is so much work to do, a lot of practice to do, and for advanced devs it has a lot of content (which I feel that a lot of platforms lack).

## Should I do it?

Depends on your expectations and your time. I really want to take my learning more seriously, and I want a good rythm, and it seems that FrontendMasters is the way to go IMHO (in my humble opinion)
