> TLDR: I had performance issues using VSCode with Node.js and Docker, and found the alternative of Vim. It was pretty easy to use after a few weeks, and using IDE-ish like [LunarVim](https://www.lunarvim.org/) and [kickstart.vim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) helped me out a lot with setups

## The current status

My employer delivered to my house the necessary equipment to start working right away. It was a [Dell Latitude 5420](https://www.dell.com/us/dfb/p/latitude-5420-laptop/pd), which is not a bad laptop at all, but take in consideration that I'm working on a big company with its own VPN and security measures.

It's like having [Kaspersky](https://www.kaspersky.es/) on your computer scanning each `npm install` that you make, each `cargo run` that you execute, and each `docker build` that you do (even local builds!). On top of that, I was using Windows 10 as a programming laptop

I started working right away, as they needed, but I couldn't do my best in those conditions. One of my options was to reduce all the unnecessary shenanigans, like Chrome extensions, VSCode extensions, local databases by using remote ones, using [Powershell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview?view=powershell-7.3) as my main command line

One day, while [ThePrimeagen](https://www.twitch.tv/theprimeagen) was streaming on Twitch, something clicked on my head. _It's just plain text on a console, it could be way more efficient that VSCode, right?_

## Let's investigate

There's [so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6AR2RMB5tE&list=PLm323Lc7iSW_wuxqmKx_xxNtJC_hJbQ7R), [many](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stqUbv-5u2s&pp=ygULbmVvdmltIHRlZWo%3D), [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PhdfcX9tG0) (and so much more) that gave me a big notion of what is going on around these kinds of editors.

## Features that I use a lot

- [X] Change between tabs (It needed a custom keymap for it)
- [ ] Close the current tab (I still don't know how to do it)
- [X] File explorer (`Space + E` in LunarVim for example)
- [ ] Git tools (diffs, untracked files, etc)
- [X] Intellisense (by using IDE-ish you can have [LSP](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) pre-installed)
- [X] Sorting (select lines, and execute `:sort`)
- [X] [Spell check](https://www.linux.com/training-tutorials/using-spell-checking-vim/)
- [ ] [Wallaby.js](https://wallabyjs.com/) and [Quokka.js](https://quokkajs.com/) (not developed yet)

As you can see, some are battery-included, some need a bit of tinkering around, and others are just deal-breakers.

## The conclusion

It's been around one month that I started my Vim journey, and I'm far from comfortable using it, but each time that some snippet comes to my mind, each moment that I type and accomplish what I need, and each second that I figured _Hey, I don't have shoulder pain anymore_ (because I don't take my hands from my keyboard) I feel like the struggle is worthwhile.
