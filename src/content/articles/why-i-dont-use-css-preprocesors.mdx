## What are CSS Preprocessors

[Quoting to MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSS_preprocessor), _is a program that lets you generate CSS from their own unique syntax_, some examples are (but not limited to) [LESS](https://lesscss.org/), [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/), [Stylus](https://stylus-lang.com/), etc.

It's clear the word *syntax*, because these preprocessors *don't add new features, it's just [syntactic sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar)*.

## What about [`styled-components`](https://styled-components.com/) or [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)?

Those two are two different entities, but I get your point:

- CSS frameworks (like TailwindCSS) enforces the standarization around CSS with your preferrable programming language ([similar definition in Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS_framework))
- CSS libraries (like `styled-components`) are specific to a programming language, library or framework

## Conclusion

You can achieve so much using just CSS. I will provide further information when I feel comfortable with this format of articles
