peace of mind immesurable to me

## What is Nix?

Taken from the [official webpage](https://nixos.org/), _Nix is a tool that takes
a unique approach to package management and system configuration_, which means
what it means: Reproducible environments.

## Story time

With the hype of AI, there's been a lot of new tools to try it out, and most of
them going off the cloud (aka running locally), most of the in Python.

Following the hype (or trying not to feel behind of stuff) I've started trying
packages, which have lots of dependencies. *Global* dependencies.

What is the problem with that? Not much at first, but if a package has a
sensible dependency between them, it could break packages between them.

For instance, let's say AIProject_A has the dependencies:

- `package_a: ^0.5`
- `package_b: ~1.0`
- `package_c: 2.3.2`

I've tried the package, it didn't work out for me, so I remove the project, but
I forgot to remove the global packages

The next project is AIProject_B and has the dependencies:

- `package_c: 2.1.2`
- `package_h: ~5.0`
- `package_z: 0.2.1`

Imagine `package_c` is a popular package that these projects use a lot (like
[openai](https://pypi.org/project/openai/)). You see the conflict there?

## Hold it right there, pyenv helps in this case

Pyenv is the solution to this, but how do you install Pyenv? Depending on the
Python version installed. How do you get Python? Using `apt`, in which you need
to specify it. And if I need another version? Depends on the OS. What about
`pip`? That's another thing.

And this is *just* Python, imagine other projects with other languages

Docker could also be the solution, but we depend on the developer of the project
creating that `Dockerfile`, and most of them don't have it

## So... What is the problem?

To be really honest, I don't know but I can't bother to know each gotcha of each
project that I explore

Nix to the rescue!

## Is that all that Nix offers?

Absolutely not! The benefits that I've found so far:

- If I change something and break it, I can rollback safely
- If I change OS and want to go back, I will have it ready
- If I want to feel in control, I use Nix

## Should I use Nix?

I don't think so, maybe if you find the same issues that I've mentioned, or
something similar.
