> TLDR: There are some people that are ready to sacrifice a lot to do what they love, and have the skillset to do so, or the confidence to do it. Currently I don't.

## The, what?

I've been collaborating with a group of talented people for almost two years in [FavForme](https://favforme.com) and before that I've worked with a close friend on [Amaranto](https://amaranto.app) for a few months

What do they have in common? They might have some reach, but they didn't get any money in return.

Does it count as a failure? Absolutely not. But I am not planning on work on a startup for a few months, maybe years from now

## But why?

Let me ask you something, do you feel comfortable building something on your own? Promoting your own thing? You think you can build something that could give value to someone? Or do you feel commited enought to build something from stratch until it works?

If you are nodding your head _but_ haven't built anything in the last three months, I am sorry but you don't quite fit in this world. Including me. At least, for now

## That was depressing, thanks

You're welcome.

In the meantime you can grow strong in technical and social skills by doing a superb work in your daily tasks, working over time, doing your research, eating healthy, sleeping well, and most important, being umpleasant at most of your time as possible. That's where real growth lies.
