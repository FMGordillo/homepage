> TLDR: I'd prefer to improve my coding skills than paying for something I don't really use

## What are Cloud certifications

From the entry level evaluations (for example, [Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/azure-fundamentals/), [Google](https://cloud.google.com/learn/certification), [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/?ch=sec&sec=rmg&d=1) and even [IBM Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/training/cloud/jobroles) has one) to highly-skilled specialized wizard jobs like cloud architect, or security specialist, and even weirded, full-stack engineer.

## And why am I not interested

You can learn for free at your own pace on most of them, and you can take a test exam on some, but the final exam has a cost (like all things in life), and most of them are above $100 (US Dollars).

You might think I'm cheap, but the main reason is the _motivation_ behind going through all the process (and again, this is just me).

* Do you want to impress an employer? -> I'd prefer to improve my skills (which are pretty weak IMO)
* Do you want your employer to pay you **more**? -> Nah, they don't appreciate that kind of training
* Do you want to work on a startup as a CTO? -> You can do it for free using [Vercel](https://vercel.com), [Render](https://render.com), [Fly.io](https://fly.io), you name it
* Is your current work linked to the usage of cloud? -> Not at the moment
* Do you _really_ love one these cloud providers? -> Not really, I invested 5 years at IBM Cloud (formally called Bluemix at the time) and here we are

## Conclusion

Everyone has its own preference (money, time, skillset, you name it), I'm not against it. But in the near future I don't see any new certificate worth my time in my portfolio any time soon.
